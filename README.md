# Secure Login Interface

A modern, responsive login interface with a built-in captcha system, designed with a defense-themed aesthetic to provide a secure and engaging user experience. The interface prioritizes both functionality and a professional design suitable for any authentication gateway.

## Features

- **Username and Password Fields** – Basic login credentials input
- **Captcha Verification** – Prevents automated/bot logins
- **Captcha Refresh Button** – Allows the user to regenerate a new captcha if unreadable
- **Password Visibility Toggle** – Improves usability on mobile and desktop
- **Real-Time Error Feedback** – Displays validation messages instantly
- **Defense-Inspired Visual Theme** – Reinforces security through strong design elements
- **Responsive Design** – Mobile and desktop friendly

## User Interface Description

The login page features a centrally aligned form with three input fields: username, password, and captcha. A “Refresh” button next to the captcha allows regeneration of a new code. The entire interface is styled with a defense-themed background to create a secure and authoritative visual tone. The design is clean, modern, and ensures accessibility and usability across devices.


## Technologies Used

- **React** – For building the user interface
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Logic for handling captcha and form interactions
- **HTML/CSS** – Page structure and custom styling
- **Tailwind CSS / Styled Components / Plain CSS** – Styling framework (based on implementation)

## How It Works

- When the page loads, a captcha image is randomly generated and displayed.
- Users fill in their username and password, then match the captcha.
- Pressing the “Refresh” button generates a new captcha without reloading the page.
- Incorrect entries trigger error messages; successful matches proceed to the dashboard or next step.
